The file contains the Netlogo code of the agent-based model related to the thesis "Agent-based modeling in support to collaborative decision-making in airport management

To use the file, don't hesitate to use the different buttons to modify the input. 

To run one simulation and see what happens : 

- Set the slider on the up from "normal" to "faster" 
- Choose all the data
- Click the button "Plane data, distribution parameters & Input"
- Set the slider "print_bool" to ON to see what happens during the simulation
- Click the button "Initialisation"
- Click the button "go" with the double arrows on it and wait until some stuff is printed
- Click again to stop the simulation whenever wanted


To run a Montecarlo simulation :

- Set the slider on the up from "normal" to "faster" 
- Choose all the data
- Click the button "Plane data, distribution parameters & Input"
- Choose the number of simulations n on the slider
- Click Montecarlo
- The results are stored in an csv file (see function MONTECARLO)
